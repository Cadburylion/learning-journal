# LJ-301-Day-15

We made it to project week! I can't believe how quickly this course has gone by. It's been a serious rush, and I've been having a wonderful time.

I'm grateful for the team I'm on! They all liked my pitch and elected to pursue that as our project. Everyone's excited, and we put in some great work figuring out our group dynamic and laying the groundwork for our app. I think it's going to turn out well--I sure hope it does!

I kinked my neck rather badly on Thursday and was nearly useless all day. Today's been tough also. I need this weekend to recover. I'll be spending it indoors on homework, tests, and resubmits! And maybe even working with my team to get an early start on our app!
