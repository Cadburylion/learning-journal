#lj-day-03

Today was awesome! I had much more time in the lab to work on what I've learned, combining what was covered in both yesterday's and today's lectures.

I was able to get the JavaScript working without much trouble, and I'm feeling more confident with it.

I don't know much CSS so I did minimal styling with it on my HTML.

I'd been nervous about using the terminal properly, and how to use GIT and GitHub, but I was able to help a fellow student create a repository, clone it, and go through ACP (Add, Commit, Push), as well as to move some files she'd been working on into the proper directory through the terminal.

It's been a good day! Aw jeah!
