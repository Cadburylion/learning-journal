#LJ-Day06

Today was DIFFICULT. The combination of learning how to operate within objects (which wasn't that hard) and then pushing to the DOM took me most of the lab to figure out. I spent the last hour or two helping out other classmates with their JavaScript portions, after struggling to get some basic CSS down. Even with a TA's help, my CSS was just not working out.

So I'll try to get more styling down soon. I really want to like CSS and think I will once I understand how to do the basics without looking every single thing up.

I'm really glad to be at the DOM stage of our class. I've been looking forward to make changes to a page using JavaScript beyond prompts and alerts.
