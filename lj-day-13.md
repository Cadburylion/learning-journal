Today was excellent! I had a great time. I spent a lot of my time working on the stretch goals for my graph, but I haven't got them yet. I was able to get local storage working pretty quickly, though it was tricky at first and came down to placement, and making sure to clear out chrome's local storage for my project as I changed code.

I probably spent the majority of my time helping other students. It's been a huge difference since Monday, when I felt totally overwhelmed and unable to recall even the most basic bits of JavaScript. I drove Lizzy's lab, and she navigated mine. I also navigated Ben. Elizabeth was a big help for us all today. She's awesome!
