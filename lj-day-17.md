# LJ-Day-17

Day two is in the bag! Today was even better. Coming into project week, I was kind of dreading it. But it's easily become my favorite week, and today proved it again. I admit, I'm just not a presenter, and Friday makes me nervous. But I know most people feel that way.

Today I worked out additional functionality, wireframed a particular page and the elements on it that are being created and posted through JavaScript, and styled them nearly to my satisfaction. It was a ton of fun!

Unlike Monday, today we had no problems merging our code (there were merge conflicts, but easily resolved). We got two pages nearly done. There are some differences of opinion among the group when it comes to styling, but that's just how it goes!

Really looking forward to the rest of the week!
