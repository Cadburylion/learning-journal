# LJ-Day-15

Friday. What a wonderful day. I'm not excited for a break from learning coding, but for a break I need to continue learning coding! I'd never coded before coming to Code Fellows, and I can say that I absolutely am in love with it. I want to learn all I can, and I want to excel.

Today we practiced something we certainly needed to: merge conflicts. I'm sure that during our first project week, we'll run into merge conflicts, and now I feel much more confident in our ability to handle them.

Also, I got to watch all but the last of the 401 project presentations. They were amazing! Professional and advanced and inspiring. As I watched them I thought, "there's no way I could ever make these", but then I thought about what I've made in just these last three weeks, and am certain that before them I would have looked at my work here and said, "there's no way I could ever make these"!

So now, a weekend to finish my homework, to rest my brain and my legs, and then into project week!
