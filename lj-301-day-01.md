# LJ-301-Day01

I'm excited to be back at Code Fellows! I needed that week off between 201 and 301, but I got plenty of rest and am ready to shred code again! Even though we're told there's less shredding in 301. Sam, our instructor, said 301 is going to be very different from 201. I'm looking forward to experiencing how!

Our first lab was awesome. I've been wanting to get into responsive web design for a while now! And I'm glad to be pair programming right away, and basically every day hereafter. It's excellent experience working with others, with Git, and with GitHub.

Bring it on 301!
