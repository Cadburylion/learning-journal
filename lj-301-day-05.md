# LJ-301-Day-05

I LOVED working through our lab together as class workshop. There were some hiccups at the beginning with misunderstandings, but Sam kept his cool, figured out the problems, and got us all through the assignment.

I worried that I wouldn't be able to keep up during the workshop, but I was very grateful to find that I was! I did make one mistake, but was able to find and fix it (a one-off typo) before I got behind.

Templating is a new concept to me, but one I really like. I can see how powerful it is, and why it's so commonly used. It's a lot to take in learning both how to template and how to do it with a new library (well, two new libraries now: jQuery and Handlebars).

As well, after the class workshop portion of the lab, we had two more styling TODO's to do, and I almost missed those! I left the class thinking that lab was done, but thankfully found out otherwise while I began work on my portfolio.

I realized I got confused with the nature of the portfolio assignments being due a day later, and wound up submitting class 04's instead of class 03's, so I got 0 points for class 03's portfolio even though I did it. I'm spending this weekend getting caught back up and organized.

I hope I'll be better prepared for week 2, even if it's harder!
