# LJ-301-Day-11

Brilliant! Today was two whole entire lung-fulls of fresh air. All throughout 201, Monday's were like terrible brick walls, and so I'd come to expect that moving forward. As Thursday and Friday of last week were particularly tough, I was bracing for something heavy to hit today. And while it's a lot still to learn, it was gentler, and enjoyable.

Rylee's a great guy and a fantastic pair-programming partner. We worked through all the TODO's with a lot of collaboration. Some of the troubles we ran into during this lab were associated with the differences with our server interactions as he's on a Mac and I'm on Linux, and I've been having some problems with opening, closing, and opening again a server (nodemon) on the same PORT number; I typically have to change the port after I've closed nodemon or it'll error out when I try to start it again on that same PORT number.

But we got it all working, and pretty quickly!

As well I had my one-on-one meeting with Sam today, and that went really well. He's a brilliant teacher and I feel like we're lucky to have him as our 301 instructor.

I'm loving this course, and looking forward to tomorrow!
