# LJ-301-Day-08

Today's class was fantastic. This is a style through which I learn a lot about the subject matter; when I go through the code, following the lines of logic all throughout the application, over and over again, I start to get it.

Still, if I want to learn how to code something, I have to write that code over and over. If I copy/paste, I don't retain it.

Working with Josh was great. We got along excellently, and flew through the lab. We're still reviewing and studying it.

I'm just very grateful for this style of instruction. Sam's willingness to explain tangential aspects of code is extremely beneficial to me, and how that we in 301 are mostly studying pre-written code to see how a thing is done is so helpful to me.
