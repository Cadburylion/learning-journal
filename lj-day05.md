Today was awesome.

It was extremely difficult for me to understand arrays. I just couldn't understand how they worked. I spent hours talking with fellow students and TA's until a white board with Ben opened caused something to click. He phrased the variables within an array as arguments, and it began to fall into place.

It took me until nearly 8pm to finish all five problems, but I enjoyed it. And this time was well spent.

Another difficulty for me was that I'm learning functions at the same time as arrays, and I didn't understand calling functions with functions and how that worked.

All in all, today was awesome.
