# LJ-Day-18

Another wonderful day! The nature of our site doesn't require much JavaScript beyond adding two different forms to a page, taking the user inputs from these forms and then populating two separate pages with objects made using this information.

In other words, we spent the day styling. Learning CSS, trying to figure out how to make each page look like they all belong on the same site. It's been a blast!
