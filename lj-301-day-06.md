# LJ-301-Day-06

Today was an awesome Monday! I got all caught up over the weekend, understood the material we covered in lecture, and had a great time with my lab partner, Justin. We completed the Lab, then worked together on our portfolio's and made some good changes to each other's code.

I'm excited to be getting into the server side, or back end, of Full Stack JavaScript. I'm sure it'll be (really) difficult, but it's something I want to know and do well.

A few of us are planning on going to the JavaScript Hack Night at 6:00pm. I'm looking forward to meeting more people in the community working in the field in which I'm being educated!

Plus, free dinner, and it's on my way home!
