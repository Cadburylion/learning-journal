# LJ-301-Day-03

Sam wasn't kidding. This was a tough one.

TJay and I worked on the Lab for over 5 hours. We completed every TODO item, but it was overwhelming. I feel like I need more time with this subject matter. More immersion. I'm struggling to understand the use of an html template saved as an object, which is then used to create new instances of that template with dynamic information using jQuery. I WANT to understand it. It's crazy interesting to me! I just honestly don't.

I'm loving 301 already. I like what we're learning and how we're learning it. And I understand that today is supposed to be the most difficult lab of the week. But I've been working on these course materials from morning (lecture on through lab) until around 11 at night, and I'm still a little behind.

Lecture is invaluable to me. I've learned that I won't learn something until I've done it myself several times over. As much as I study demo code and the like, and feel at the time like I get it, when I sit down to do it, I'm blank.

So today was a tough one. A tough one in which I learned a lot, and I'm looking forward to more!
