# LJ-Day-19

Our last day! At least, this is our last full day of development.

And we finished our site. We're happy with our styles, we squashed all the bugs we know about, and we worked well together as a team! I think as big a part of this project as building the actual site has been learning how to code with others as part of a team. It's been difficult and beneficial learning how to unify sometimes differing ideas and visions into one unified product. But I think we've done it!

Now, to present it!
