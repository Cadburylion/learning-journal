What. A. Hard. Lab.

But an awesome one. Michael and I worked really well together, and learned so much. This kind of programming is intensely rewarding to me. We needed a good deal of help, and through it were able to dig down into deeper understandings of so much of our code; .map, .filter. and .reduce are very powerful tools for working with data in arrays!

One thing about which I'm worried is that, while we finished this lab, got it working, and know why it's working (which is incredible to consider), I know I would not be able to code out this blog app on my own from scratch. I don't think I'm expected to be there right now anyway, but it's hard for me to move on to new concepts, when my hold on previous practices is still tenuous.

All the same, I am loving this. Time to put what I've learned here into my portfolio!
