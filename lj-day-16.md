# LJ-Day-16

Project week is my favorite week.

The group I'm in got right into the project first thing in the morning. We planned our site, we drew out wireframes, and we built out almost all of our functionality in one day. We also got a lot of practice working with GitHub and how to resolve merge conflicts, one of which took us the better part of an hour untangling.

This is so much fun. We're putting what we've learned into practice on functions of our own choosing, and it's working! I've actually learned how to do a lot, in a very short time! There were a few days where I was sure I wasn't getting any of this. But we were utilizing every single thing we've learned up to this point, and getting it done.

I think the single greatest thing I learned on the first day of project week is how helpful programming in a group can be. It's so much more difficult to get stuck in a pit of frustration when there's others around who can pull you out.
