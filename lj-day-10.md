#LJ-Day-10

Today was a perfect end to a difficult week. I knew my knowledge of CSS was severely lacking, and so a full lab dedicated to it was just what I needed. I learned a whole lot during the assignment to work in pairs to build a mockup page based on a picture.

And it was the kind of mind-break I needed after being jammed so full of some difficult (for me to understand) JavaScript. But I feel satisfied, proud of the work I put in, and all the more excited to be a student at Code Fellows.
