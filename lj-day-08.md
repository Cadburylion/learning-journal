#LJ-Day-08

Today went so much better than Lab 7. I completed the technical requirements in around an hour, and better understood the concepts covered in Lab 7.

After completing the form took in the user's input and ran it through an object constructor to create an object and then append the necessary information to the table I built in Lab 7, I spent the rest of my time in lab to play with CSS. I don't know if I learned much more than that I have so much more to learn.

Yesterday I didn't get finished until around 8:30. All in all, I needed a day like today.
