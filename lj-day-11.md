#LJ-Day-11

Today was ROUGH for me. I wasn't expecting it to be, because I feel I've been understanding what we've covered up to this point. But when I got to the lab, it was all blanks. Straight up empty brain. I struggled until around 7:30 to get ANYTHING done, and finally made some basic progress. But what I accomplished I should have been able to do in an hour.

I don't know why today went down like this, but it was so difficult for me. I am staying late and trying my hardest! With help from Morgan, a TA, I did finally start to make progress, and have some of the technical requirements for this lab finished, but just a few.

I really hope I can catch up tomorrow!
